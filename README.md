## 🧠 Overview
  
**Civix** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and resolving local civic issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, and uncollected garbage. It provides a bridge between citizens and municipal authorities, bringing accountability and transparency to local issue resolution.

## 🚨 Problem Addressed  
Local civic issues often go unnoticed or unresolved due to:  
- Lack of structured, user-friendly reporting systems  
- No transparent status tracking  
- Difficulty in community prioritization

## ✅ Running Tests

We have a comprehensive testing suite to ensure code quality and stability.

### Backend Tests (Jest & Supertest)

These tests cover the API endpoints. They run against an in-memory MongoDB database to ensure a clean, isolated environment for each test run, preventing any impact on your development database.

To run all backend tests, navigate to the `/backend` directory and run:
```sh
npm test
```

### Frontend Unit & Component Tests (Vitest)

These tests verify that individual React components render and behave correctly in isolation. We use Vitest and React Testing Library for this.

To run all frontend unit tests, navigate to the `/frontend` directory and run:
```sh
npm test
```

### Frontend End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Cypress)

E2E tests simulate real user workflows in a browser from start to finish. This helps catch bugs in critical user journeys like logging in, creating a post, or navigating the application.

To open the Cypress Test Runner, navigate to the `/frontend` directory and run:
```sh
npm run cypress:open
